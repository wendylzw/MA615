# Hurrican Mapping Assignment

For each of these maps make two maps that match them in functional appearance. In other words, the
information available on the map you make should be the same as the information available on the maps
above – even if, for example, the colors are different. You will make four maps in total.
The first map for Floyd-1999 and Allison-2001 should be made with either the usmap
package or with ggplot2.
The second map for Floyd-1999 and Allison-2001 should be made with either leaflet or
tmap.
For this project, please work in the same groups you used for the buoy project. The list of groups is attached.
Each group should have a github that will be used to share the group’s code. Each group will be assigned
another group for code evaluation. You will receive evaluation procedure instructions on Monday. Each
groups will fork another group’s project for review and evaluation. Please be sure that your code conforms
with the Google R Style Guide and that it runs.
Final maps will be due (as gitnub URLs) from each individual as well as the group.
