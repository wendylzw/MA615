## Data Description
This report is a limited data exploratory analysis of Berry data from the USDA database selector: <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov">https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov</a>. The data were <a href="https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/results/D416E96E-3D5C-324C-9334-1D38DF88FFF1">stored online</a> and then downloaded as a CSV file.

The Berry data displays the survey statistics of three kinds berries based on the simple filtering rules of What, Where, and When.[link]https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/param_define and [link]https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/src/glossary.pdf. describe different variables of Berry. And My task is to explore these variables and my goal is to support the agricultural research team for analysis and modeling.


## Method Overview
There are three steps of my work:
- step1: Data Cleaning and Organizing
- step2: Exploratory Data Analysis
- step3: Shiny App

Analysis was conducted in R Studio (Version 1.3.1073). Data cleaning was performed using package stringr (Grolemund, Wickham 2011) and package tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) ). Time series analysis was conducted using package astsa (Stoffer, 2020), linear regressions were conducted using package rstanarm (Goodrich B, Gabry J, Ali I & Brilleman S., 2020) and figures were produced using the package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009). This report was compiled by Knitr (Yihui Xie, 2020).


## step1: Data Cleaning

### Time Series Model

First I plot monthly average air temperatures over the 30 year period(1987-2016), shown below:

\includegraphics{season-atmp.png}


Then I do the same for monthly water temperatures over 30 year period(1987-2016), shown below:

\includegraphics{season-wtmp.png}

We can observe that the overall trend of temperatures is hard to interpret because of the seasonal changes.

Using the time series sarima forecast function to predict the seasonal trend we have shown below.

The forecasting result is not clear whether the overall temperatures are rising or decreasing, and there are a lot of fluctuations too (gray area), so it's not prudent to make any judgment based on this model alone.

## Step2: Explorary Data Analysis
Abstract data of year 1987 to 2016 from the NDBC website, only keep the columns of year, month, day, hours, air temperature and water temperature. Transform temperatures to doubles and year month day hours to integers.

I only explore air temperature and water temperature at noon(hh=12), as the representative of the highest temperature for the day. Then I calculate the average monthly temperature for each year, using these daily noon temperatures. The reason why I only select temperature at noon is to avoid daily fluctuations which will affect the mean, so I pick one hour of the day to be consistent.

## Step3: Shiny App

## Conclusion

Based on the time series models, the seasonal trend of air and water temperatures is not clear.

Based on the linear regression models, for both air and water temperatures, most months have rising temperatures over the last 30 years. January, February and November have decreasing temperatures. This is within expectations, since colder winters are consistent with Climate change. 

Although we cannot 100% confirm global warming in the past 30 years, we can conclude that for the past 30 years, around Boston area where this buoy collects data, Summers, Springs and Autumns in Boston are getting hotter, while Winters are getting colder. 

This analysis certainly contains its limitations. The data is collected at one location on this planet, and my analysis only accounts noon temperatures. Further investigations could include more data collections around the globe, include more variables like CO2 level, and study daily, seasonal, and yearly temperature fluctuations.
